    Initialisation strategies: 
        Pymc sampler: We initialise all chains to the same point generate uniformly in a chosen interval;
                      We can also set a initial point for each chain.
        Numpyro (Nuts): By default we set the initial point accordingly to the numpyro approach.
                        A starting point is drawn uniformly within a symetric interval (Default [-2,2])
                        We think that the same point is allocated to all chains, so to have the setting we decide to initialise 
                        the chains of pymc sampler by the same starting point.

    now we set an uniform initialisation per chain for all smapler

    Problem to solve: Obtaining the log likelyhood from estival for the idata generated by numpyro.
